# ml-brain-tumor-detection
A PyTorch-based CNN model detects brain tumors from MRI images. It preprocesses data, extracts features through convolutional layers, and classifies scans as tumor or non-tumor. Trained with Adam optimizer, it achieves high accuracy, aiding early diagnosis and medical decision-making.
